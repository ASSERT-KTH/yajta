# yajtaÂ (Yet Another Java Tracing Agent)

yajta is a extensible library for byte code probe insertion. Its built on top of javassist. It allow to build tracing agent but is not limited to this task. Probe insertion can be done both offline and at load time. So far, probe can be inserted only at the begining and the end of methods. 
It now also supports insertion at any branching point (Offline only so far).

Further more several tools that make us of that library are provided:

 * An agent that allow probe insertion at run time (See [Agent_README](Agent_README.md)) (Exemple of traces collected on common open source libraries can be found [here](https://github.com/KTH/execution-traces).)
 * An agent that check that an execution follow a previous trace (See [Follower_README](Follower_README.md))
 * A tool that generate a test impact report (A json file containing for each method of the explored project the list of test the call it.) (See [TIE_README](TIE_README.md))
 * A way to insert probe offline (See [API_README](API_README.md))
